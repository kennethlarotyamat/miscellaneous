Performance Score: 52
    Remove Excess Javascript, I have a lot of ads there, and I think that I have duplicates for the
    performance analytics from google that may no longer be active.

Accessibility Score: 66
    Add Iframe titles and Image alt text, I removed those fields to make it easier to manage, but it does have a negative
    effect on my Accessibility score. So I'll Make those updates as they come along.

Desktop:
    I've received all error messages for this section of the analytics report. My guess is that I'll have to change
    things to make them easier to load on the desktop.


1. Figure out how to deal with multiple page redirects, which seems to slow down my website quite a bit, I might have to Figure
out another way of hosting my website rather than through the blogging application, or figuring out another alternative through
the domain management system.

2. Reduce Unused Javascript. I think that I will remove old web traffic analytics widgets on my website, as well as reduce the
number of ads my page hosts. The issue of third-party scripts also affects this score.

3. Increase accessibility by reintroducing alt text, iframe titles, and aria attributes for users using assistive technologies.
