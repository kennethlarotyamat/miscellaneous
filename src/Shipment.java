The following symbols are used in reporting and recording graduate student grades:

A		Superior (4.0)
B  		Passing (3.0)
C   	Average (2.0)
D		Below Average (1.0)
F		Failing

AD		Audit (not graded, no credit toward GPA)
I   	Incomplete (expires after one year; if not grade is submitted in that time-frame, the ‘I’ will default to an ‘F’ grade)

S  		Satisfactory

X		Hold: Grade is submitted upon completion of Thesis or Dissertation or Professional Paper
		Note: Faculty members have the option of using plus (+) and minus (-) for grades of A, B, C, and D. Exception: A+ grades are not given. 
		At the graduate level, grades below a B are generally considered unacceptable. Graduate students must have a 3.0 GPA in order to qualify for graduation.
		
		What a nightmare. So the highest possible grade I can obtain in the course is a C, but it's not clear to me. As a graduate student, if I would get a 2, or a 0.
		I would rather get a C than audit the class.

/*

After all the packages are entered, the program will prompt the users to enter if they have “frequent-shipper” numbers; 
if so, a 5% discount will be applied to the shipping cost. If the total amount after the frequent-shipper discount is greater than $300, 
an additional “bulk package” discount of $20 off would be applied. The program shows the total number of packages to ship, subtotal 
before discount, frequent-shipper discount if applied, bulk package discount if applied, and the grand total.
